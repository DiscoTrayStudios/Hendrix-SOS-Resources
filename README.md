## What does SOS stand for?
Student Outreach Services (SOS)

## What do we do?
Student Outreach Services, or SOS, is a unique and progressive program designed to support students as they transition from high school and home life to college and future life through a structured, collaborative, and confidential process. This is done via a holistic and total wellness conversation between the SOS representative and a student prior to the student being connected with needed programs, services, and individuals. The mission of SOS is to engage all segments of the Hendrix student population by connecting students with mentors, services, resources, programs, interventions, and/or preventions to increase successful, holistic, and positive student experiences.
